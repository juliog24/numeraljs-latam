### Formats

Formats now exist in their own files and act more or less as plugins. Check out the [bytes format](https://github.com/adamwdraper/Numeral-js/blob/master/src/formats/bytes.js) for an example of how to create one.


### Locales

When naming locale files use the [ISO 639-1 language codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) supplemented by [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country codes when necessary.

### Locale translations will not be merged without unit tests.

See [the english unit tests](https://github.com/adamwdraper/Numeral-js/blob/master/tests/locales/en-gb.js) for an example.
